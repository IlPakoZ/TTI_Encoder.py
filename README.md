# TTI Encoder

This python project enables you to convert <b>any</b> text document saved in any encoding format (ASCII, ANSI, UTF-8, Unicode...) in an <b>image</b> using a locally and randomly generated <b>key file</b>.<br>
The generated image contains the text from your document converted in image data, which can only be decrypted using the key and the <b>Decryption Tool</b>.<br>

To use the Encryption and Decryption Tool you need a working <b>Python 3.7 Interpreter</b>,  the <b>png module</b> (which need to be in the same directory as the python script) and the chardet module, already distributed within the project files. <br> 

To use the Encryption Tool, simply open your Python 3.7 Interpreter in the folder in which you extracted the python scripts and execute the command <b>"python TTI_Encoder.py"</b>: the program will automatically run and ask you for the information it needs. <br>
The same happens with the Decryption Tool. The command to run it is <b>"python TTI_Decoder.py"</b>.<br>
